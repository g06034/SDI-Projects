    <h2>Project 1</h2>

<p> My theme chosen for Project 1 is about a video game called Destiny. It's a mix of a few genres of game but not classified as one. The genres used to descibe it are: Action role-playing, First-person shooter, and MMO. There are different classes, races, and weapons. The different classes are: Hunters, Warlocks, and Titans. For this story I chose the Warlock. The classes affect your in-game performance in different ways.</p>
<p> In Destiny you get to choose between three different races as well. Those races are: Humans, Awoken, and Exo. These races only affect you appearance in-game, but not your in-game performance.</p>
