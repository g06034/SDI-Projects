<p>For my week 2 project I chose to change my story to make it easier to fulfill the requirements of this week. The story is about my routine of getting to my job on the weekdays. I work Monday through Friday.  My job is an hour and a half away from my house. I have some essentials that I take everyday, including my contractor badge which is required on the job and must be visible at all times. I also have a wife and a daughter who just turned 1, so I will need to have my cellphone. My cellphone will need to be on at all times, in case of an emergency at home. </p>
