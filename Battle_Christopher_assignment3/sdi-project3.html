<p>For my story I used my love of music.  I am going to play basketball soon but I need to listen to some music first. I will also bring my music to the gym so I can lift weights after, unless I play basketball too long. In this story I will be giving you a brief look at my process for listening to music and then playing basketball.</p>
<p>When I go to listen to my music I have many options to choose. First I have to figure out which of my three devices I want to listen to music on. Then when I go to play basketball I need to decide how many people will play on each team and which of my friends I will choose for my team. </p>
