<p>The story I chose for my Project 2 assignment is a more in-depth introduction of my waking up. I start off with a tough decision of me deciding whether or not I will wake up immediately or snooze it. I usually have at least three alarms set for snoozing if necessary. The alarms are 5 minutes apart from each other.  Then I must decide if I want to make tea or not. I also have coffee maybe once a week so that is something I choose if I would like to do. Once I hit the road I check my gas gauge to see if I should stop and get some gas on my way to work.</p>
